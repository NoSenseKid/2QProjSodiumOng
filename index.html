		    In this guide, I will help you learn more about roles and held items 
		    in the game. Roles are the use and purpose of each Pokémon in a game. It gives us an idea 
		    of its strength and weaknesses. Held Items are things that can increase your Pokémon’s strength 
		    like giving more damage, health points, or movement speed and only a maximum of 3 held items 
		    can be placed in one Pokémon. The part where it gets difficult is when you choose your roles 
		    and held items and how you play with it. That is why I created Unite Lab and Stuff, my website 
		    about Pokémon Unite, to help you overcome the difficulties and make you a better player.

		    Hello there trainers! I am Gian Ong, the one who created this guide. I'm just a high school
		    student who likes to play video games. I also have experience in playing mobile games especially 
		    Mobile Legends. When Pokemon Unite was first released in mobile, I loved the game but the ranking system 
		    has a flaw. There are newbies in high rank games which ruins the fun for those who wants to solo rank. It also
		    made me think that most players that started Pokemon Unite don't really play MOBA games before. I want to help 
	        make the game more fun by giving newbies some game knowledge and a school project just been announced back then. 
		    I realized that this should be my topic and this is how I started this guide.
